        "This week I worked on Naive Bayes and it helped me understand how classification works using simple probability. At first, I thought Naive Bayes would be very complicated, but once I started doing the tasks, I realised the idea is actually straightforward. We only need to count how many times something appears in the dataset and then use those counts to calculate the likelihood. The part that took me a bit of time was keeping track of the conditional probabilities, especially when some values did not appear in a class. But doing the tasks step by step made it much clearer.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also enjoyed applying Naive Bayes to different small datasets such as accident prediction, weather decisions, loan approval, and disease diagnosis. Each dataset showed me that the same method can work in many situations. It made me feel more confident because I can now look at a table and quickly work out the probabilities. It also helped me understand why Naive Bayes is called “naive”, because it assumes all features are independent even when they are not. But even with that limitation, it still works surprisingly well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another helpful part of this week was implementing a simple Naive Bayes classifier in Python. Even though the code was short, it helped me see how the algorithm works behind the scenes, without using built-in libraries. Seeing the calculations in Python made everything feel more real than just doing the maths manually. Overall, this week improved my understanding of probabilistic models, and I feel more comfortable working with classification problems now."
